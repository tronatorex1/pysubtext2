In this video, I'll show you how to read from a file in Python.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,160
The first thing we need to do is open the file.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,320
You're going to say, file equals open.

4
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,960
My file is called file.txt.

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,160
So I put that right there.

6
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,440
And then I put R as the mode that I want to open this file

7
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,800
in that stands for read.

8
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,440
Now, if your file is done the same directory as your Python file,

9
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,400
then you need to put in the absolute path to this file.

10
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,000
So C, colon slash slash, et cetera, whatever the path is to it.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,720
If it's in the same directory, you can just put the name of the file.

12
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,600
Now, to actually read from the file, what you do is the following, print,

13
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,720
and then file.readlines like that.

14
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,920
For readlines, we'll give you a list containing all of the lines in the file.

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,720
Once you're done with the file, you need to make sure you close it.

16
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,720
So file.close.

17
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,640
When I run this, notice we get all of the lines inside of the file.

18
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,840
We just read the file.

19
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,520
Another way to do this is simply with read.

20
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,840
If you use .read, notice you're going to get a string that contains all of the text

21
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,280
in the file, but not based on its lines.

22
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,680
Finally, a quick way that you can do this as well that avoids you having to close it.

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,240
So say with open file as file like that, then you can read the file inside of here.

24
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,680
Now, you no longer need to close it.

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,680
Let's run the code.

26
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,680
Notice everything works.

27
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,680
Hopefully you found this helpful.

28
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,000
