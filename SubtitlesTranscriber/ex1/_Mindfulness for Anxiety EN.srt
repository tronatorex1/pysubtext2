00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,100
By the end of this video, you're going to know how to use mindfulness in your life.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,360
You're going to experience mindfulness with two quick activities and you're going to

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,360
learn how mindfulness can help you calm your body and your mind.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,840
The skill of mindfulness shifts your perspective on emotions.

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,840
You'll learn how to get better at soothing anxiety.

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,440
You'll learn to process sad feelings and you'll learn to quiet negative self-talk.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,320
This combined with CBT has been shown to work as well as medication at treating depression

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,300
and anxiety, but without the side effects.

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,100
And it's more effective in the long term.

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,220
Mindfulness actually helps rewire your brain.

11
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,520
It helps improve connectivity between neurons and the part of your brain that processes

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,040
emotions.

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,480
In skill number five, we looked at how avoidance and struggle with our emotions tends

14
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,200
to make us miserable or at the very least keeps us from living the life we dream of.

15
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,640
So what's the alternative?

16
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,920
Is it just suffering?

17
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,920
No.

18
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:10,080
Today we'll look at mindful acceptance as a step toward resolving emotions.

19
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,900
When things get stressful, do you find yourself coping in unhealthy ways, like overeating,

20
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,800
venting, or just avoiding things altogether?

21
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,280
These strategies may work in the short term, but eventually they'll end up causing more

22
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,600
problems than they solve.

23
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,280
Even what it'd be like if you had the skills to work through tough emotions without losing

24
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,280
it.

25
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,820
My online course, Coping Skills and Self-Care for Mental Health, takes you through the

26
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,080
process of creating your own healthy coping and self-care routine.

27
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,180
You'll learn to identify triggering situations, manage intense emotions, you'll learn to call

28
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:46,200
me your stress response, and build your own personalized coping skills list so that you

29
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,240
can handle different situations.

30
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,480
By the end of the course, you'll show stress, anxiety, and depression that they don't

31
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,800
run your life because you'll have the skills to manage emotions in healthy ways.

34
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,620
When we're mindful, deeply in touch with the present moment, our understanding of what

35
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:13,080
is going on deepens, and we begin to be filled with acceptance, joy, peace, and love.

36
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,960
Have you ever had an experience where you were intensely aware of the moment?

37
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,400
Maybe it was a beautiful sunrise or even a frightening experience.

38
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,040
And suddenly you started noticing the tiny details of each thing around you?

39
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,040
Perhaps you noticed the way the light was hitting the trees or the feel of the dirt beneath

40
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,360
your feet.

41
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,080
Maybe you heard the sound of the birds or maybe even of your own breath.

42
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,160
Everything felt real, crisp, the moment felt magical, you felt alive.

43
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,480
Write about that experience in your workbook.

44
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,880
Or if you're on YouTube, you could write about the experience in the comments section

45
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,040
below.

46
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,280
On the other hand, have you ever felt like you were just numb, you're plowing through

47
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,160
the day, you're trying to just not think about your life or just waiting for it to get

48
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,160
better?

49
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,920
Maybe you felt that way for weeks and months on end.

50
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,160
Now we often attribute these feelings of joy or misery with the outside circumstances.

51
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,840
So for me, I remember time I felt like the world was alive when I was hiking in Hawaii.

52
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:17,200
So we might think, oh, the beautiful sunrise gave me joy and my daily grind gave me misery.

53
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,280
But there is another way to look at that.

54
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,720
So what if it was the state of awareness that brought joy and the habit of distraction

55
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,320
and avoidance that brought misery?

56
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,040
Our minds, our hearts and our bodies have an innate healing ability.

57
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,240
We have a natural drive to heal and resolve problems to find joy and to grow.

58
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,800
When we stop interfering with that natural drive, when we stop distracting ourselves

59
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:46,520
endlessly and we start acknowledging instead of avoiding all of our feelings, we give ourselves

60
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:51,600
the freedom to come back to ourselves and to find peace and joy.

61
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:57,360
Our brain has a natural ability to file away our problems and to resolve them in the

62
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,680
down time.

63
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,560
But if we never give ourselves quiet time, then it creates this backlog of issues to file

64
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,720
away.

65
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,920
So some medications that you might have a problem with distraction are you have a hard

66
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,360
time sleeping and that could be because your mind is finally getting a chance to sort

67
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,040
through your thoughts.

68
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,520
Or if you always need music on your phone or if when you sit still with nothing to do,

69
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,800
you feel sad or anxious.

70
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,360
This can all be caused by being kind of addicted to distraction and busyness.

71
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,960
On the other hand, we can train our minds to feel joy and vitality by developing our

72
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,200
present moment awareness.

73
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:41,800
So instead of needing to escape, right, to feel different experiences to feel happy like

74
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,720
a vacation or when in the lottery, we can create joy in the present moment by waking up

75
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,120
and living.

76
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,400
Acceptance in my opinion is the key to convert momentary happiness to enduring happiness.

77
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,640
It helps you move from feeling happy to actually being happy.

78
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,200
So what is mindfulness?

79
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,120
mindfulness is just being aware.

80
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,120
That's it.

81
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,560
It's being aware of what we're experiencing in the here and now.

82
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,000
So for example, are you aware of the chair pressing against your legs right now?

83
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,760
Well, now you are mindful of that.

84
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,720
Another way to describe it is to be awake to the present moment.

85
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,120
We can practice mindfulness.

86
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,880
We can actively work out those mindful muscles by focusing our awareness on our bodily sensations,

87
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,080
our thoughts and our emotions.

88
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,280
If we do this while actively accepting the present moment, thoughts, sensations and emotions,

89
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,040
we can develop more internal power.

90
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,440
Now there's that word again.

91
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,480
I actually wish there was a better word in English than acceptance because acceptance

92
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:48,320
has this connotation of giving up or just saying, well, I'm just going to accept that life

93
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,080
sucks and it always will or some crap like that.

94
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,800
But that's not what it means at all.

95
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,280
At least when it's used in the therapeutic sense, acceptance as we use it here is simply

96
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,160
acknowledging what is here in the present moment.

97
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,120
And it's choosing to allow it to be there and choosing to be awake to that.

98
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,120
That's it.

99
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,040
It's getting grounded in here now and noticing what it feels like.

100
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:16,320
Now another way to describe it is willingness, choosing to be willing to feel.

101
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,560
It's starting with where we are and going from there.

102
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,360
So with difficult emotions, this can be really hard because we don't necessarily want to

103
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,600
feel sad or we don't want to feel anxious.

104
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,520
What's the alternative?

105
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,800
I do feel anxious so I'm going to try and pretend like I'm not.

106
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,120
I do feel anxious so I'm going to try and make that go away.

107
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,960
Well, that makes things worse.

108
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,760
In football, they start each play where the ball is, not where it could have been or

109
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,080
where it should have been or where the team wants it to be.

110
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,480
Willingness is about starting where we're at.

111
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,720
So imagine how football game would go if every player spent time arguing about where the

112
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,520
ball ought to be or where they want it to be or wishing they had done better the previous

113
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,040
play or worrying about the fourth quarter or trying not to think about where the ball

114
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,040
is because they don't like it.

115
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,040
Right?

116
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,680
That would not be a very enjoyable game.

117
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,520
Same thing goes with our emotions.

118
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,600
Acceptance or willingness doesn't mean we aren't trying to move forward.

119
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,560
It just means we know where we are starting.

120
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,240
It's amazing how much our lives we spend not noticing being mindless.

121
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,080
We regret about the past or we long for the past.

122
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,520
We worry about the future or we daydream about the future.

123
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,480
All the while we're just trying to escape the now.

124
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,560
We keep our minds distracted by music or TV or Facebook or work.

125
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,600
We try not to notice the pain that we feel all the while not realizing that if we just

126
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:43,080
accept that it exists right now, it tends to not hurt so much.

127
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,000
Mindfulness is pretty simple to learn in practice.

128
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,800
So let's try a little experiment.

129
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,800
For this you're going to need a little bit of food.

130
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,800
Like it could be some trail mix or raisin, a chocolate chip or a piece of bread, whatever.

131
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
Right?

132
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,680
Just pause the video, go find a little piece of something to eat.

133
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,120
Eating is one of those things that we often do while multitasking.

134
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,760
We might eat while we watch TV or talk on the phone or we just keep working while we

135
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,840
down a sandwich.

136
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,360
Distracted eating is associated with weight gain, overeating and decreased enjoyment

137
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,360
of food.

138
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,040
So go ahead, get out your little piece of food but don't eat it yet.

139
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,200
Take a moment and look at the food, really see it.

140
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:24,120
Pretend that you're an alien who has landed on a strange planet and you get to describe

141
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,920
food for the first time ever.

142
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,720
What do you see?

143
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:35,400
Notice the texture, the light on it, its shape, whether it's soft or hard, coarse or smooth.

144
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,040
Now feel it in your hand.

145
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,920
Is it light, heavy, warm or cool?

146
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,480
Notice any thoughts that come up.

147
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,600
Like why am I doing this?

148
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,760
And just let those thoughts be there and then shift your tension back to the food.

149
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,560
What do you notice in your body?

150
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,920
Are you starting to salivate?

151
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,720
What does that feel like?

152
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,200
Bring the piece of food up to your nose.

153
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,520
Does it have any smell?

154
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,760
Bring it up to your ear, does it make any sound?

155
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,400
Bring the piece of food to your mouth.

156
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,400
Isn't that interesting that your hand knows exactly where to go?

157
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,960
Now I'm going to ask you to gently place it in your mouth but don't chew it yet.

158
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,600
What do you notice about it?

159
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,320
Feel it on your tongue, its weight, its temperature, its size, its texture.

160
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,640
Roll it around in your mouth and explore the sensations of it in there.

161
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,080
Now when you're ready, intentionally bite into it.

162
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,720
Did you automatically pick a side to chew on?

163
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,440
Notice when you start to taste the food.

164
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,800
Slowly, slowly chew the food.

165
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,680
And notice when you feel a desire to swallow.

166
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,880
What does that feel like?

167
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,960
When you swallow, notice what it feels like to swallow.

168
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,320
Can you feel the food moving down toward your stomach?

169
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,440
Congratulations, you've just had your first taste with mindfulness.

170
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,720
You noticed what it feels like to do something that you often do mindlessly.

171
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,920
Now let's talk quickly about the difference between mindfulness and meditation.

172
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,800
Meditation is an activity.

173
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,320
Mindfulness is a state of awareness.

174
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,240
Meditation is when you stop doing what you're doing and you spend a certain amount of time

175
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,240
in mindfulness or in a meditation activity.

176
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,240
Now mindfulness can be done by stopping what we're doing and focusing on it.

177
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,240
But what I love about mindfulness is that it can also be done while we're in the middle

178
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,240
of whatever else we're doing.

179
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,240
And it can bring joy and awareness to our task at hand.

180
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,240
Now I tend to suck at meditation.

181
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,240
I find it really hard to do.

182
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,240
I find it difficult to set apart time to do it.

183
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,240
But when I do it, it is beneficial.

184
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,240
On the other hand, mindfulness is a practice that's a lot easier for me because I can do it

185
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,240
while I'm doing whatever else I'm doing.

186
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,240
And it brings vitality to the task at hand.

187
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,240
So let's talk about what are the characteristics of mindful acceptance?

188
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,240
The first one is present moment awareness.

189
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,240
You keep bringing yourself back to the here and now.

190
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,240
Number two is a non-judgmental approach.

191
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,240
You don't label your initial thoughts, emotions, or sensations as good or bad.

192
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,240
Mindfulness is not having a sense of the feeling of the mind.

193
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,240
It is not having a blank mind, making your mind go blank.

194
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,240
It's allowing yourself to keep shifting your focus to what you choose to focus on.

195
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:20,240
Instead of letting your focus be pulled away by whatever your mind wants or whatever is going on around you.

196
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,240
The third characteristic of mindfulness is non-striving.

197
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,240
We aren't trying to force change.

198
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,240
We're not trying to make our thoughts, emotions, or sensations go away.

199
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,240
This activity is about being where you're at while you are there.

200
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,240
Another characteristic of mindfulness is to have a beginner's mind.

201
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:42,240
To be curious about your experience as if it's the first time you've ever felt that.

202
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,240
You ask questions like, what does it feel like to feel this?

203
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,240
And then another aspect of mindfulness is expanding awareness.

204
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,240
So you might be noticing that you're feeling anxious or sad.

205
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,240
And then you expand your awareness and you say, what else am I feeling?

206
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:03,240
So an example of this is when maybe an elderly person who was suffering has died.

207
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:08,240
You might feel super sad, but you might also feel grateful that they aren't in pain anymore.

208
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:15,240
So mindfulness gives you a chance to explore the subtle emotions in addition to the loud ones.

209
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:22,240
Often mindfulness helps us feel a sense of calm or increased joy in the moment, but that's not the goal of mindfulness.

210
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:28,240
Sometimes mindfulness makes us feel worse, especially when we've been chronically avoiding or distracting ourselves.

211
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,240
The goal is not to make you feel better. The goal is to get better at feeling.

212
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:39,240
To like a weight lifted to increase your emotional muscles so that heavy things seem light.

213
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:45,240
Not because the nature of the weight or the emotion has changed, but because our ability to lift it has increased.

214
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,240
Mindfulness is also not a relaxation technique.

215
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:56,240
We can do tons of relaxation techniques later, but that won't bring us happiness if we're just using them to attempt to escape or avoid our emotions.

216
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,240
So as you practice mindfulness, focus your intention on what you are feeling instead of what you want to be feeling.

217
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:10,240
When we're feeling distracted or detached from the present moment, we can quickly return to the present by utilizing our senses.

218
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:17,240
So here comes exercise number two.

219
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:23,240
So for our second activity, we're going to try a very short mindful breathing activity.

220
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:28,240
So for a moment now, just bring your attention to your breath.

221
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:36,240
Notice what it feels like for your breath to come in and your breath to go out.

222
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:51,240
Now the purpose of this activity is not to change your breathing. It's to notice it as it is.

223
00:13:51,240 --> 00:14:00,240
But there's something about noticing that leads to feeling a more relaxed sense of whatever you're experiencing.

224
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,240
So for a lot of people, their breathing starts to get slower and deeper.

225
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:10,240
But again, that's not the goal of the activity. It's just to notice your breath.

226
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,240
What does it feel like for the air to come in your nose?

227
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:24,240
What does it feel like for the air to go out?

228
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,240
Now it's normal for your mind to wander.

229
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:38,240
Like I said before, the goal of mindfulness is not that your mind goes completely blank, but that you practice returning your attention to what you choose to pay attention to.

230
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,240
So for this activity, your mind might wander.

231
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:48,240
When you notice that your mind is wander to just gently bring it back to noticing what it feels like to breathe.

232
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:04,240
Does the air change temperature as it comes in and out?

233
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:17,240
Pretend like you've never experienced breathing before or like you're an alien from a planet where breathing doesn't happen.

234
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,240
Be curious about the experience of breathing.

235
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:27,240
What does it feel like to breathe?

236
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:38,240
If your mind wanders, just bring it back to the present moment.

237
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,240
And you've just practiced mindfulness. That's the second way to do it.

238
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,240
The breath can be an anchor for our attention and our focus.

239
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:58,240
When you find yourself feeling distracted or irritated or agitated, you can bring yourself back to the present moment by simply paying attention to your breathing.

240
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,240
And this is one of the most simple basic ways to practice mindfulness throughout your day.

241
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:10,240
So now that you understand the basics of mindfulness, you can practice this throughout the day or when experiencing a strong emotion.

242
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,240
So take a minute to be mindful.

243
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:20,240
As you scan your body, allow those emotions or sensations to be there and then check for what else is there, what else is going on.

244
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:28,240
Check in with your body, your mind and your emotions as if you were a curious scientist, exploring and describing the experience for the first time.

245
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,240
The full course has many more mindfulness activities.

246
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:37,240
Choose at least one of the following activities to practice mindfulness while doing one of your daily activities.

247
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:43,240
You can also check out my grounding skills playlist if you'd like to try a couple of meditations.

248
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:55,240
The practice of mindfulness can help you reduce anxiety and depression, can help you get better at feeling your emotions, and it can help you relax and feel more centered and more rich and more connected to your life.
