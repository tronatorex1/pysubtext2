00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
Hello and welcome to another tutorial from Moe City.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:10,680
In this one I'm going to demonstrate how to generate automated subtitles for any videos

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,400
you want using Python.

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,000
To get started on this one first you will need to install this pip package called OpenAI

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Whisper.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,520
So this package allows us to create a transcription, English transcription for any video.

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,600
You can also use it to translate the language as well.

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,600
If you have a video that's in a different language and you want to create or generate

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,600
subtitles in English, you can also do that.

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:42,100
So this is the pip package website and you can pretty much scroll down and see exactly

11
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:47,100
how everything is laid out, what kind of dependencies do you need.

12
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,600
You might also need the package called FFMPEG.

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,320
And that's also required to read the video files or if you want to display the video

14
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,680
and audio files as well.

15
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,320
They do support a large array of different languages.

16
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,760
You can take a look at how well kind of stuff they actually support and using the package

17
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,280
is actually quite easy.

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,320
Let me just show you the code that I've been using to generate subtitles for my videos.

19
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,080
At the moment this is literally the code that I'm using.

20
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:30,080
So I'm using the first I'm just importing Whisper, Whisper utilities, import the get writer

21
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,080
function, then load the model I'm using the base model here.

22
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,240
If you go to the website you can see the different models that they use.

23
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,320
So you have base, I need base small medium large.

24
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,760
I'm using the base one because I had some of the videos that were quite long.

25
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:54,040
So I want to make sure that I get as accurate subtitle as possible.

26
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,800
For the audio file I'm simply passing in them before file that I have and I'll play

27
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,440
that for you in a minute.

28
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:07,520
For the result I'm basically saving the transcription of the audio file and I'm disabling the FFP16.

29
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,080
So my CPU doesn't support FFP16.

30
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,560
So I'm just disabling that so it runs the FP32 mode instead.

31
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,120
And then on the setting up the output directory here.

32
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,000
Now I need to save the files as a BTT file because that was one of the requirements for

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,080
you to me when I released my new course on there.

34
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,320
The didn't accept SRT files but if you need to say generate SRT files for your videos

35
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:40,200
you can also just change the BTT to SRT and it will generate SRT files as well.

36
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,960
Okay, so let's stick to the BTT one for now.

37
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,920
So it's just basically running the get writer function file type and the output directory.

38
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,480
Okay, basically we're just running this to transfer up the audio file and save the results.

39
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,840
Okay, so before we run this one let me just show you the video.

40
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,920
So this video is from my quiz maker app development course that I've recently released

41
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,920
on due to me.

42
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,840
So if I just play this one this is the assignment video I believe.

43
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,800
Hello and an application.

44
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,520
So right now the one saved on the computer.

45
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,720
So this is on when it's designed to challenge you in a way where you can take an existing

46
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,240
program and add four functionalities to the program to enhance its usability in the

47
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,240
long run.

48
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,240
Let me just show you guys.

49
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,000
As you can see there's no subtitles on the video currently.

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So I just need to add a subtitle so I can add more accessibility to the course.

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,760
So I just need to do here right now is I'm just going to run this one.

52
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:47,320
As run depending on the size of the video your the time is going to take to transcribe

53
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:52,400
the entire project might take a while but this is only a three minute video so you shouldn't

54
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,400
take that long.

55
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,400
Right now the subtitle has been generated as you can see there's a dot VTT file on here.

56
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,320
So if I click on that.

57
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:07,760
You can see that he has transcribed or transcribe the whole video with the timestamps on

58
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,120
it.

59
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,080
And now mind you the transcription for the videos are not 100% all the time so you might

60
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,800
still need to edit the files a little bit.

61
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,680
I find it a lot easier to simply edit the files rather than generating the files myself.

62
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:29,680
Okay so let's play the video again and let's see the results of the subtitle.

63
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,240
Hello and welcome to this assignment.

64
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,680
So one of the issues you can see here is it's hello and welcome to this assignment.

65
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,640
This is all instead of four.

66
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,640
Right.

67
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,600
So I'm going to use the minor four uses which make our app development course which is

68
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
given.

69
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,880
And I click apply it gets applied to the image here.

70
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,040
Okay so imagine I want to use this image here to the quiz right now.

71
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,960
So I have the link for the image right there.

72
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,960
Okay.

73
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,320
And then I want to add that to the program.

74
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,920
I'll go to add image.

75
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:11,280
I can paste the link into the text box here and click apply.

76
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,280
Right.

77
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:19,360
And if I save this quiz with a random question which is going to create and check the quiz

78
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,360
here.

79
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:29,040
You can save onto my location as the images and files here are local.

80
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:34,240
This would enhance your own features and functions that apply to your own project.

81
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,240
Okay.

82
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,120
I think the subtitle results are really good.

83
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:46,120
And with this small minor tweaks I can pretty much use this subtitle file for my video.

84
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,320
So I really hope you found this one useful and you can generate your own subtitle for

85
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,000
your videos and you know it helps you in some way.

86
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,080
The link to my new course is in the description here.

87
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,120
