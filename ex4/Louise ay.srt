00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
I was one of the early ones saying that if you're willing to change your thinking, you can

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,900
change your life, your thoughts create your reality, and nobody understood that at the

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:09,900
time.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,960
But it was something that I understood very quickly.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,160
So I started to study more and more and more and made change my own life.

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,760
My own life became much better.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,800
I started to get what I call the green lights in the parking places, the little things first.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,560
And the more I studied and the more I practiced and the more I was willing to forgive and to

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,360
appreciate life and to have a lot of gratitude, the more my life changed for the better.
